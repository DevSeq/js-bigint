BigInt [![Build Status Image][]][Build Status]
======

Enables working with integers beyond 53 bits (the upper limit of what
JavaScript's `Number` type can accurately represent).

This is a pure JavaScript library, unlike other libraries that do the
same thing.

***Note:*** This is still a very early version and a lot of operations
are missing.


Example
-------

Here's how to create a `BigInt` from a series of binary values:

```js
var bigint = require('bigintjs');

console.log(bigint('99999999999999999999999999999').add('1').toString());
// 100000000000000000000000000000

// Bitwise operations on a big number (JavaScript only supports up to 32 bits)
var value = bigint('0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF').and('0xF0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0').shiftLeft(8);
```


Using this package
------------------

You can install this package with [NPM][]:

```bash
npm install --save bigintjs
```

To be able to run this in a browser, you need to use a framework that
supports CommonJS modules (for example: [Browserify][]).
